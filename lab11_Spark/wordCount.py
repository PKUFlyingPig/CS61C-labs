    - Explanation:
    -
    - `flatMap` takes in a function that will take one input and outputs 0 or
    -   more items. All returned results are combined into a single list of
    -   items that future functions are run on. We use this function to
    -   transform our document into a list of words.
    -
    - `map` takes in a function take in one item, perform an action on it, and
    -   return the result. When called on a list, it applies the function to
    -   each item in the list. We use this function transform our words into
    -   `(key, value)` pairs, with the key being the word and the value being
    -   the number of times it occurs.
    -
    - `reduceByKey` groups a list of `(key, value)` pairs by keys and runs a
    -   function on each key which takes two values and returns a single value
    -   (i.e. "reducing" them two inputs into one). It will be called
    -   iteratively on each key until only a single value remains for that key.
    -   We use this function to sum the number of times a word occurs.
