 *
 * So it looks like you've decided to venture into the "other" files of this
 * lab.  Good.  C Header files (the .h extension) are a way of telling other .c
 * files what they can have access to.  You usually include stdlib.h in your
 * C programs, and this process is identical to including this .h file with the
 * one change being:
 *
 * #include "file.h"
 * versus
 * #include <file.h>
 *
 * The difference is that the <> notation is for system header files and the ""
 * is for ones you provide yourself (in your local directory for instance).
 *
 * The header file starts off with
 * #ifndef CS61C_VECTOR_H_
 * #define CS61C_VECTOR_H_
 *
 * and ends with a final #endif.  This prevents the file from being included
 * more than once which could've possibly resulted in an infinite loop of
 * file inclusions.
 *
 * First, we define the 'vector_t' datatype.  This next line says that a 'vector_t'
 * is the same as a 'struct vector_t'.  So anywhere in the code after this, we
 * can use 'vector_t *' to mean a pointer to a 'struct vector_t' (which is defined in
 * vector.c).  We can get away with doing this even though we don't know what a
 * struct vector is because all struct pointers have the same representation in memory.

 *  is a way of telling the .c files that #include this header what they will
 *  have access to.
